## Public Projects (🔗 Public repositories on my profile)

> Short descriptions and what I implemented — click the repo names to explore.

- **Realtime AI Voice Agent**  
  A low-latency interactive voice assistant built in Python. Implements streaming STT → LLM → TTS pipelines for conversational, near real-time responses. Good demo of building-block modular design for voice agents.  
  `[`Realtime AI Voice Agent`](https://github.com/VivreSaVie08/Voice-Agent-Model)`

- **Quantum ML for Malware Detection**  
  Experimental work combining quantum feature extraction and classical/quantum classifiers to detect Android malware. Includes notebooks, preprocessing pipelines, and noise-aware QKSVM / VQC experiments. Useful for research comparisons and benchmarking.  
  `[`Quantum-Machine-Learning-for-Malware-Detection`](https://github.com/VivreSaVie08/Quantum-Machine-Learning-for-Malware-Detection)`

- **Road-Safety / Real-time Infrastructure Monitoring**  
  End-to-end project (Smart India Hackathon style) for monitoring infrastructure progress: GIS-based visualization, mobile frontend, Django REST backend, and ML forecasting for completion times. Full-stack + ML integration.  
  `[`Road-Safety-App`](https://github.com/VivreSaVie08/Road-Safety-App)`

- **IITB-CPU — 16-bit Multicycle RISC Processor**  
  VHDL implementation of a 16-bit multicycle RISC CPU with testbenches and project report — great for learning datapath + control FSM design and FPGA verification.  
  `[`IITB-CPU-Architecture`](https://github.com/VivreSaVie08/IITB-CPU-Architecture)`

- **Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)**  
  Notebooks and experiments with snnTorch / SpikeSim — unsupervised and supervised SNNs on MNIST / CIFAR. Explores surrogate gradients, ALIF neurons, and neuromorphic behaviors.  
  `[`Spiking-Neural-Networks`](https://github.com/VivreSaVie08/Spiking-Neural-Networks)`

- **Interactive Web Crawler**  
  Python crawler with recursive link extraction, plotting of crawl graphs (Matplotlib), plus a tiny web UI to trigger and visualize runs. Useful for web-structure analysis and scraping demos.  
  `[`Interactive-Web-Crawler`](https://github.com/VivreSaVie08/Interactive-Web-Crawler)`

- **Call Scheduler & Manager**  
  Flask demo for scheduling outbound calls (mock API), sqlite persistence, and a simple frontend. Good for quick demos of background jobs and REST APIs.  
  `[`Call-Scheduler-Manager`](https://github.com/VivreSaVie08/Call-Scheduler-Manager)`

- **Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews**  
  LSTM-based notebooks and a quick Gradio demo script for sentiment classification. Good example ML pipeline from dataset → model → demo UI.  
  `[`Sentiment-Analysis-for-Movie-Reviews`](https://github.com/VivreSaVie08/Sentiment-Analysis-for-Movie-Reviews)`
